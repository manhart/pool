# Pool
POOL stands for PHP Object-Oriented Library. It is a PHP framework for object-oriented programming. It is based on the MVC pattern and is designed to be as simple as possible. It is therefore particularly suitable for beginners in object-oriented programming. 

Keep it simple and stupid!

## About Pool

The framework is designed to be as simple as possible and to be used as a basis for your own projects. It is therefore not a complete framework, but only a basis for your own projects.

Key features are:

- Developer-friendly (easy to learn)
- MVC pattern
- Modularity (also known as the component or modular system principle)
- Simple templating via Template Engine (separation of logic and presentation)
- Skinnable Interface / Theme Support
- Multi-language (I18N) support
- Enhanced UI Schema Management: Unlike traditional systems that emphasize HTTP request routing, our framework prioritizes advanced UI schema management, ensuring a more intuitive and efficient user interface design.
- Easy and convenient access to databases such as MySQL/MariaDB or MSSQL through Database Access Objects
- Integrated AJAX Simplification: Automatic client-server module pairing for easy asynchronous requests, complete with streamlined security features.
- Enhanced Input Security: Server-side validation with adaptive filters and fail-safe default values.
- Enable easy creation of custom APIs (RESTful) for your own projects
- Streamlined Cron Job Management: Simplify the scheduling and management of tasks directly within the framework
- Advanced Authentication Support: Includes Single Sign-On capabilities and integration with systems like KeyCloak, as well as custom login dialog options.
- Optional Caching Mechanisms: Offers the flexibility of optionally enabled caching solutions, utilizing Memcached to boost performance as needed.
- Simple logging
- Simple error handling
